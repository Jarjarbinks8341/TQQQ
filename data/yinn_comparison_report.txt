KEY INSIGHTS
================================================================================

1. FULL PERIOD (2020-2026): STRATEGY SAVED $3,200
   - YINN crashed from $585.91 to $13.58 (97.7% decline)
   - MA Crossover limited losses to -47.41%
   - Buy & Hold lost -79.41%
   - Strategy's defensive positioning protected capital during severe bear market

2. RECENT PERIOD (Oct 2022-2026): STRATEGY LOST $2,675 TO WHIPSAW
   - YINN recovered from $13.58 to $46.12 (+240% from bottom)
   - MA Crossover returned -2.75% due to 41 false signals
   - Buy & Hold gained +24.00%
   - Choppy recovery market with frequent crossovers created whipsaw effect

3. MARKET CONTEXT
   - 2020-2022: Severe bear market in Chinese leveraged ETFs
   - Oct 2022-2026: Volatile recovery with multiple failed rallies
   - Signal frequency similar (11.8 vs 12.8/year) but outcomes vastly different

4. STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS
   ✓ MA Crossover excels as DEFENSIVE tool in severe downtrends
   ✗ MA Crossover struggles in choppy, range-bound recovery markets
   ✓ Strategy's value is CAPITAL PRESERVATION, not growth
   ⚠ High signal frequency (12-13/year) indicates volatile, whipsaw-prone conditions

5. WHEN TO USE THIS STRATEGY
   - Strong bearish trends: Excellent (saved 32% vs buy&hold)
   - Recovery periods: Poor (lost 26.75% vs buy&hold)
   - Best for: Risk-averse investors prioritizing capital preservation
   - Not ideal for: Growth-seeking investors in recovery markets

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

The MA5/MA30 crossover strategy is a DEFENSIVE tool, not a growth strategy.

Over the full 6-year period, it successfully limited catastrophic losses during
YINN's 97.7% crash, outperforming buy-and-hold by 32 percentage points.

However, in the recent 3.2-year recovery period, the strategy underperformed by
26.75 percentage points due to whipsaw from 41 signals in choppy conditions.

The strategy's true value lies in CAPITAL PRESERVATION during severe bear
markets, not in capturing gains during volatile recoveries.

For YINN (3x leveraged Chinese ETF), this defensive approach proved valuable
over the full period, saving $3,200 on a $10,000 investment compared to
buy-and-hold, despite underperforming in the recent recovery phase.
